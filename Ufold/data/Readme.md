## Data

Due to the space limit, the datasets are not uploaded. The unbias data is only locally available. It can be recreated using the python script create_file.py <br>
The biased data was provided by Mag. Stefan Badelt, which was also used for testing [RNA Deep](https://github.com/ViennaRNA/RNAdeep) <br>
The remaining data sets (ArchiveII, bpnew, TS0, TS1, TS2, TS3) are available under [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sq7MVgFOshGPlumRE_hpNXadvhJKaryi?usp=sharing)
